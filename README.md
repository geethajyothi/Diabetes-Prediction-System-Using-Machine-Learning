# Diabetes-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels, which can lead to severe health complications if not managed properly. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction system using machine learning techniques to assist in early detection. The system leverages Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers to predict diabetes based on patient data, including age, insulin levels, pregnancies, skin thickness, diabetes pedigree function, and blood pressure. The models are trained on a balanced dataset to ensure reliable predictions. A web application built with Django provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health parameters and receive predictions. The accuracy of the models is evaluated and compared, providing users with a robust tool for diabetes risk assessment.
